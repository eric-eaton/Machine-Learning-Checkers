# Machine-Learning-Checkers
The goal of this project is to use computer vision to create an Artificial Intellegence which plays checkers against a human opponenet
The first step in this is creating a version of checkers playable by a machine in python.
To do this, I created a checker board using a numpy array. 
The next step will be making the player object with the actions the machine will be able to take during the game
The next step will be creating an independent bot which can execute the commands given to the player object.
The next step will be creating a nueral network model which will control the decisions the bot makes.
The next step will be training the model by setting two models to play against eachother.
The winner of each game will have a copy made and altered, which the original will then play against. This will continue until a model which can consistently win is generated.
The next step will be creating a computer vision setup which can identify pieces on a real checker board.
The model will then need to be fit to the computer vision system and able to play checkers with that input instead of the numpy array. 
The final step will be testing the model against a human opponent.
There is no timelime for this project, just something I will be working on in my free time.
